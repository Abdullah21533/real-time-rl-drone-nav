# 🛸 Real-Time RL Drone Navigation

This repository contains a complete reinforcement learning (RL) project that enables a drone to navigate real-time environments using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization). The project uses the `Stable-Baselines3` framework and includes enhanced visualization, graph overlays, and final video output with background music.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🔄 Real-time interaction using `CartPole-v1` (can be extended to drone simulation like AirSim).
- 🧠 Trained with Stable-Baselines3's PPO algorithm.
- 📈 Live reward plotting during inference.
- 🎥 Video generation with reward overlay and background music.
- 🐍 Python-based implementation with clean modular structure.
